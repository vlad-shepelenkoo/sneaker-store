          <h3 class="mb-4">OUR STORY</h3>
          <p class="fs-6 fw-medium mb-4">The SNEAKER STUDIO, founded in 2008 – based in Düsseldorf, grew to an international well-known sneaker store. Our assortment of products grew from year to year. Besides classic sneakers we are also releasing limited and exclusive sneakers. Over the years we have collaborate and worked with big brands such as Nike, Adidas, ASICSTIGER, Diadora or KangaROOS. Besides the big projects, we also love to work with local partners like the Fortuna Düsseldorf, our favorite ramen restaurant Takumi or our friends from Kumanga. With every new event or project, we are pushing our boundaries to the max. This helped us to grow to the SNEAKER STUDIO we are today. After the whole years of business, the SNEAKER STUDIO is still a Family business, which owned by the two brothers</p>

              <h5 class="mb-3">Projects & Events</h5>
              <p class="mb-3">With the growing awareness we came into contact with more and more brands. The wide product range led to more creative activations and large projects. Over the years, we have repeatedly demonstrated our creativity in various projects. With brands like ASICS SportStyle, Diadora, Nike or Adidas we have already worked together and collaborated partly for sneaker models. We also regularly use our store for events Get-Together with the SNEAKER STUDIO community. No matter if in summer or winter, for (almost) every project there is also a party in our store.</p>

              <h5 class="mb-3">Let’s build the SNEAKER STORE</h5>
              <p class="mb-3">After two years the of “Schuh-You” the store has been totally redesigned and renovated. It took more than three Month for the whole redesign. On the 16.July 2011 everything was ready – the SNEAKER STUDIO has finally opened its doors. The old wooden floor of the “living Room” was completely ripped out and the olive-green walls got new paint. The new SNEAKER STUDIO literally shines in its new design thanks to the green glow in the dark floor and the clean white painted walls. The whole design and the concept were made by the brothers themselves. The new design and the rename to SNEAKER STORE were also the start for featured projects and countless events.</p>

            <h5 class="mb-3">The bigger, the better</h5>
            <p>After numerous events and party, it was about time to get more space. Not only for the visitor, but for the growing range of products and sneaker as well. And because of the positive reputation in the sneaker scene, limited releases and rare sneaker found their way to Düsseldorf. So it was just the next logical step to have more space. It took 2 months to completely renovate the store. DIY was still a big thing and everything was carefully planned. We doubled the store size and installed big windows around the stores to let natural light beam in.</p>
